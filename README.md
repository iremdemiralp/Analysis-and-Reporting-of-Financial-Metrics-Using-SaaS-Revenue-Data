# Analysis and Reporting of Financial Metrics Using SaaS Revenue Data

## Project Overview  
In this project, I analyzed time series revenue data from a SaaS (Software as a Service) company and developed an interactive dashboard in Power BI to monitor key financial metrics effectively.

## Dataset Structure  
The dataset includes the following columns:
- **user_id**: Unique customer ID  
- **payment_date**: Date of payment  
- **location**: Customerâ€™s geographic region  
- **software_name**: Name of the purchased software  
- **is_enterprise_customer**: Indicator of enterprise customer status  
- **revenue_amount**: Amount of payment (revenue)  

This structure enabled multi-dimensional analysis across time, customer types, software products, and geographic locations.

## Dashboard Content  
The Power BI dashboard is designed for interactive analysis and contains the following elements:

### Cards:
- **Total Revenue**  
- **Users**  
- **New MRR**  
- **ARPPU (Average Revenue Per Paying User)**  
- **Revenue Change Percentage**  
- **Average Customer LTV**  

### Slicer:
- **Location filter**

### Visuals:
- **Cohort Matrix**: Revenue cohort analysis by month  
- **Donut Chart**: New MRR distribution â€“ enterprise vs. individual customers  
- **Clustered Column Chart**: Total revenue comparison by location and product  
- **Stacked Column Chart**: Monthly revenue distribution by product  
- **Line Chart**: Total revenue by location over time  

## Key Insights and Contributions  
- Comparison between different customer segments  
- Monitoring of revenue trends over time  
- Regional performance visualizations  
- Tracking of ARPPU and LTV metrics  
- Cohort-based analysis of user behavior over periods
